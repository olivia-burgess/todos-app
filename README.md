# Todos App

## App ideas
- filtering and sorting by category, due date and priority
- seperate completed and noncompleted
- conditional if date is today display today, tomorrow display tomorrow, if overdue display overdue OR maybe just make it the date and have it red color?
- add local storage so unsigned in users can use the app make a popup that they should create account if they want it safely stored
- add user profile so they user can manage their categories and priorities e.g. add new priority 'critical'
- add dark mode
- give barrel exports a go
